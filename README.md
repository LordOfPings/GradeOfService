# Grade of Service based routing strategies - Senior project

The project is focused on optical wavelength routed networks with dynamic provisioning of lightpaths. The possibility of differentiating Grade of Service among different classes of lightpath requests is thoroughly investigated throughout this work. As a result, a set of mechanisms and routing strategies that allow an optical network operator to achieve differentiated lightpath blocking probability is proposed. Simulation results show that all proposed mechanisms and strategies managed to achieve the stated goals in assumed network conditions and successfully delivered GoS-differentiated services. Based on the obtained performance results, the suitable wavelength division for achieving maximum Number of Lightpath Established and minimum Blocking Probability
